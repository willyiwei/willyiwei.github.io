## About Me

Hi, I’m Will Yi. I lead a software development team at Cisco, where I focus on building intelligent wireless services. I’ve always loved solving problems with technology, but what really drives me is working with great people and turning ideas into something real. Outside of work, I’m a dad, a distance runner (my longest so far is a half marathon ~ 13.1 miles), and an enthusiastic investor — especially when it comes to long-term value growth. I’m always learning, whether it’s through side projects, market research, or chasing new personal goals. I believe life is like a sport — it takes discipline, resilience, and passion to keep growing. This site is a place for me to share what I’m building, thinking, and exploring — and hopefully connect with others along the way.

### My Leadership Philosophy

I believe in:

- Empowering engineers to own their work
- Building trust through transparency and accountability
- Scaling through clear process, mentorship, and technical rigor
