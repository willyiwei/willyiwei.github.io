## About Me

I'm Will Yi — a software development leader with deep experience in wireless networking, AI-based platform intelligence, and distributed system design. At Cisco, I’ve led cross-functional teams that drive innovation at scale, improve system reliability, and deliver enterprise-class products.

### My Leadership Philosophy

I believe in:

- Empowering engineers to own their work
- Building trust through transparency and accountability
- Scaling through clear process, mentorship, and technical rigor

Outside of work, I enjoy mentoring early-career engineers, exploring emerging tech, and spending time with my family.
