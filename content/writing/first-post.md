Iâ€™ve been leading engineering teams for over a decade, and I finally decided it was time to create a space to share what Iâ€™ve learned.

- My approach to leading high-impact teams
- Lessons from shipping complex software at scale
- Thoughts on AI in wireless systems and infrastructure
- Personal experiments and side projects

Stay tuned ðŸ‘‹
